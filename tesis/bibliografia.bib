abstract = {Recent technologies have enabled us to collect diverse types of genome-wide data at an unprecedented scale and in multiple dimensions. Integrative computational methods are greatly needed to combine these data to provide a comprehensive view of the underlying biology and human disease. An ideal method should be able to automatically extract relevant features by exploiting heterogeneous data across various modalities and dimensions to answer a specific biological or medical question. The key challenge in developing such methods is the design of a comprehensive model capable of harnessing noisy and high-dimensional datasets without much manual supervision. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) algorithms, especially deep learning, offer a unique opportunity to mine and provide a systematic understanding of massive heterogeneous biological datasets. In this chapter, we describe the principles of integrative genomic analysis and discuss existing ML methods. We provide examples of successful data integration in biology and medicine with a specific focus on omics (e.g., single-cell RNA-seq) and image data. Finally, we discuss current challenges in integrative methods for genomics and our perspective on the future development of the field.}

abstract="This paper reports on the design and implementation of a 12 lead high resolution electrocardiograph. The proposed equipment incorporates advanced digital techniques enabling the estimation of intra-QRS potentials. The analysis software should perform in real-time the averaging of QRS complexes as well as digital filtering for extracting the intra-QRS potentials. Additionally, the time-series corresponding to the RR intervals should be estimated and processed in the frequency and time domain. One of the contributions of this research will consist on the development of a robust technique for the estimation of QT intervals operating simultaneously on each of the recorded leads. Analysis of QT time-series intervals could be performed using either Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or wavelets, aiming at deducing quantitative indexes of heart pathologies. The proposed system is intended as tool for the early detection of Chagas disease and their stratification. For attaining this goal a fusion stage would be incorporated. During this stage the software should provide a quantitative index based on several electrocardiographic (ECG) quantitative parameters estimated from the recorded leads.",
