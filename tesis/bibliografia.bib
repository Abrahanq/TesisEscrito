abstract = {Recent technologies have enabled us to collect diverse types of genome-wide data at an unprecedented scale and in multiple dimensions. Integrative computational methods are greatly needed to combine these data to provide a comprehensive view of the underlying biology and human disease. An ideal method should be able to automatically extract relevant features by exploiting heterogeneous data across various modalities and dimensions to answer a specific biological or medical question. The key challenge in developing such methods is the design of a comprehensive model capable of harnessing noisy and high-dimensional datasets without much manual supervision. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) algorithms, especially deep learning, offer a unique opportunity to mine and provide a systematic understanding of massive heterogeneous biological datasets. In this chapter, we describe the principles of integrative genomic analysis and discuss existing ML methods. We provide examples of successful data integration in biology and medicine with a specific focus on omics (e.g., single-cell RNA-seq) and image data. Finally, we discuss current challenges in integrative methods for genomics and our perspective on the future development of the field.}

The goal was to prototype an ECG database for assessing the quality of ambulatory ECG monitoring (A ECG) systems. After the ‘concerted action’, the development of the full database was coordinated by the Institute of Clinical Physiology of the National Research Council (CNR) in Pisa and the Thoraxcenter of Erasmus University in Rotterdam. Thirteen research groups from eight countries provided A ECG tapes and annotated beat by beat the selected 2-channel records, each 2 h in duration. ST segment (ST) and T-wave (T) changes were identified and their onset, offset and peak beats annotated in addition to QRSs, beat types, rhythm and signal quality changes. In 1989, the European Society of Cardiology sponsored the remainder of the project. Recently the 90 records were completed and stored on CD-ROM. The records include 372 ST and 423 T changes. In cooperation with the Biomedical Engineering Centre of MIT (developers of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database), the annotation scheme was revised to be consistent with both MIT-BIH and American Heart Association formats.},

abstract="This paper reports on the design and implementation of a 12 lead high resolution electrocardiograph. The proposed equipment incorporates advanced digital techniques enabling the estimation of intra-QRS potentials. The analysis software should perform in real-time the averaging of QRS complexes as well as digital filtering for extracting the intra-QRS potentials. Additionally, the time-series corresponding to the RR intervals should be estimated and processed in the frequency and time domain. One of the contributions of this research will consist on the development of a robust technique for the estimation of QT intervals operating simultaneously on each of the recorded leads. Analysis of QT time-series intervals could be performed using either Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or wavelets, aiming at deducing quantitative indexes of heart pathologies. The proposed system is intended as tool for the early detection of Chagas disease and their stratification. For attaining this goal a fusion stage would be incorporated. During this stage the software should provide a quantitative index based on several electrocardiographic (ECG) quantitative parameters estimated from the recorded leads.",

	abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) and wavelet transform (WT) are two powerful techniques for feature extraction. In addition, fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) is among considerable techniques for data reduction. In other words, the aim of using FCM is to decrease the number of segments by grouping similar segments in training data. In this paper, four different structures, FCM-NN, PCA-NN, FCM-PCA-NN and WT-NN, are formed by using these two techniques and fuzzy c-means clustering. In addition, FCM-PCA-NN is the new method proposed in this paper for classification of ECG. This paper presents a comparative study of the classification accuracy of ECG signals by using these four structures for computationally efficient early diagnosis. Neural network used in this study is a well-known neural network architecture named as multi-layered perceptron (MLP) with backpropagation training algorithm. The ECG signals taken from MIT-BIH ECG database, are used in training to classify 10 different arrhythmias. These are normal sinus rhythm, sinus bradycardia, ventricular tachycardia, sinus arrhythmia, atrial premature contraction, paced beat, right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Before testing, the proposed structures are trained by backpropagation algorithm. All of the structures are tested by using experimental ECG records of 92 patients (40 male and 52 female, average age is 39.75±19.06). The test results suggest that FCM-PCA-NN structure can generalize better than PCA-NN and is faster than NN, FCM-NN and WT-NN.}
